# Hack the North Frontend Challenge

Source code for my Hack the North frontend challenge built using React, hosted on [Github Pages](http://edwinzhang.me/htn-challenge)

## For local development

* Clone the repository and navigate to the directory
* Install dependencies with ```npm install```
* Run with ```npm start```

## Possible Extra Features

* Gauge interest in activities based on number of people who add events to their personal queue
* Seeing what events other people are going to
* Filter events by most popular
* Different buttons to directly filter each tag
* Clicking on a location creates a pop-up map with directions
* Export personal schedule to Google Calendar etc.
* Search bar suggestions
* Draggable cards
* More vibrant card UI
* Automatically delete events that are over
* Display the time until the next event

## Performance fixes

* Binary search for personal schedule insertions
* Faster search filtering algorithm
* Use CSS modules or anything with better structure
* Optimize for mobile
* Get the PWA working over HTTPS instead of using localStorage for data
